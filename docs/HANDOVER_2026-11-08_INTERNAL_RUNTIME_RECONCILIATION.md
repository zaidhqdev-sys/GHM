# Handover — Internal Runtime Reconciliation (2026-11-08)

**Record timestamp:** 2026-11-08 12:48–13:00 UTC (reconstructed retrospectively)  
**Repository baseline inspected:** `main` at `0e2c7c2181d457265a671a6f857140dd17faee97`  
**Purpose:** Restore the missing operational record for the 2026-11-07 runtime deployment and the 2026-11-08 follow-up. This is an evidence-based reconstruction, not a claim that a contemporaneous handover was maintained.

## 1. Non-negotiable operating rules

- `GHM-Internal-Runtime` (`srv-damupsek1f9s73eq8kkg`) is the sole deployment target for this runtime rollout.
- Render auto-deploy for that service must remain **disabled** (`autoDeploy=no`, trigger `off`). It is intentional. Never enable it.
- `ghm-payfast-sandbox-runtime` is a separate service and is not a deployment target or readiness indicator. Its associated free-tier PayFast sandbox database has expired/suspended; do not use it for this rollout.
- No cherry-picking, no rewriting/updating the user's local checkout, no bulk deploys.
- Any future release rollout must be one coherent release at a time, with the exact candidate identified, deployed only after authorization, and verified before proceeding to the next release.
- Do not treat a successful build/startup as proof of full application health, migration completion, or production readiness.

## 2. Current source and runtime pointers

### GitHub

- Repository: `zaidhqdev-sys/GHM`
- `main`: `0e2c7c2181d457265a671a6f857140dd17faee97`
- Commit message: dependency security baseline refresh from PR #212; Node engine aligned with AWS SDK requirement.
- Parent: `b7883862dfa175e8ee4ba8b12fda00ce3c71d644`.
- The immediately preceding production checkpoint recorded by Render was `d6d35194bfa05c9395acc8622ed620d48222d318`.
- The comparison from that checkpoint to current `main` is a large accumulated change set (previous inspection reported 201 commits ahead). The November 7 deployment therefore advanced the service to the consolidated `main` tip; it was **not** a sequence of individually deployed and verified releases.
- A separate local baseline previously supplied by the owner was `1f23d88b23a2f54c9d77742b4f47c980b3823e65`. Nine commits were identified between that local baseline and current `main`; this is not the full gap from the deployed `d6d3519` checkpoint. Do not infer that the nine-commit list is the complete rollout history.

### Render — sole internal runtime

- Service: `GHM-Internal-Runtime`
- Service ID: `srv-damupsek1f9s73eq8kkg`
- URL: https://ghm-internal-runtime.onrender.com
- Branch: `main`
- Build: `npm ci && npm run build`
- Start: `npm start` (`node dist/server.js`)
- Health-check path configured: `/healthz`
- Region: Frankfurt; one instance; Free plan.
- Auto-deploy: **off** (`autoDeploy=no`, `autoDeployTrigger=off`) on the latest read-only service inspection.

### Latest observed deployment

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Deploy ID | `dep-dbnp1nou01pc73dbrki0` |
| Status | `live` / deploy event succeeded |
| Commit | `0e2c7c2181d457265a671a6f857140dd17faee97` |
| Started | 2026-11-07 20:58:10 UTC |
| Finished | 2026-11-07 20:58:31 UTC |
| Trigger | `service_updated`; event records environment updated |
| Previous deploy | `dep-dbnorgu7bikc73d51ie0`, same commit, manual, later deactivated |

The Render event record shows the latest deploy completed successfully. Logs show `npm start`, `node dist/server.js`, and “GHM Core Engine listening on port 10000”. This proves process startup and listener initialization at that time; it does **not** prove every route is healthy or that all expected database migrations are applied.

## 3. Deployment sequence discrepancy — important

Render history shows several manual deployments on November 7 before the final service-updated deployment:

- `21a64d8` / PR #208 merge at 20:24 UTC
- `80de663` / PR #210 merge at 20:27 UTC
- `d6d3519` / PR #212 merge at 20:29 UTC
- `0e2c7c2` / current `main` at 20:44 UTC (manual deployment), then again at 20:58 UTC (service-updated deployment)

The service history therefore confirms manual deploys of successive mainline tips in that window, but not a controlled per-PR release qualification/verification record for every intervening commit. The final live pointer is `0e2c7c2`. This is a factual record, not an endorsement of that rollout method. It does not satisfy the owner's stated future requirement for one coherent release at a time with verification between releases.

**Do not attempt to replay the older commits now.** That would roll the live service backward and may create source/schema incompatibility. First establish the actual database migration state through the approved owner-controlled audit path, then define a forward-only recovery/release plan.

## 4. Runtime observability — evidence and limits

### Observed application errors

The Render app log query for `GHM-Internal-Runtime` from 2026-11-07 20:50 UTC through 2026-11-08 12:45 UTC returned seven application error entries between 20:59:13 and 21:02:35 UTC on November 7. Each was emitted as:

```json
{"event":"http_request_failed","error":{"name":"error"}}
```

The error logger does not expose a useful message, stack, route, request ID, or underlying database/provider cause. The available evidence is insufficient to identify root cause. Do not speculate that these errors are caused by the dependency refresh, the schema issue, database permissions, or any particular endpoint.

A request-log query for November 8 00:00–12:45 UTC returned no request log entries. This is an absence of returned records, not proof that no requests occurred or that the service was healthy. No useful request metrics were available in the preceding inspection.

### Health verification

- Render marks the latest deployment live and the process logged that it was listening.
- The configured `/healthz` endpoint has not been independently confirmed by a successful external probe in this evidence set.
- Previous direct endpoint retrieval attempts were inaccessible from the inspection environment. An inaccessible probe is not evidence of an application outage.
- Therefore status is **process started; full HTTP/application health unverified**.

### Follow-up required

- Improve structured error logging in a separately reviewed code change: include safe error message/class, stack where appropriate, route template, request/correlation ID and safe causal metadata; never log secrets, credentials, tokens, or payment data.
- Re-run an approved external health/route smoke test and record exact time, URL/path, HTTP status, and response classification.
- Diagnose the seven observed errors using correlated application/provider/database evidence before proposing a fix. Do not patch based on the redacted log line alone.

- Branch: `fix/production-schema-reconciliation-profile-authority`
- Head: `c71ea86d72958ca8fa489100955ee36f3823ff45`
- Base: `main` at `0e2c7c2`
- Status at inspection: open, not merged, non-draft.
- CI run #2135 was reported successful; Cloudflare Pages preview succeeded at https://fix-production-schema-reconc.ghm-cu1.pages.dev.
- Proposed migration: `20261107211500_reconcile_business_profile_and_founder_authority.sql`.
- Scope described by PR: add missing nullable Business projection fields (`latitude`, `longitude`, `logo_storage_object_id`), add absent constraints/index idempotently, restore private founder-reviewer allowlist table and exact lookup function. Reviewer allowlist remains empty; no identities are seeded and no verification status is changed.
- PR explicitly says no production DB change or deployment is included; disposable PostgreSQL qualification is required before any production application.
- The PR description associates this with two reported HTTP 500s. That is the PR's stated rationale; it does not prove these schema differences caused the seven generic runtime errors above.
- **Do not merge, deploy, or apply this migration based only on CI/preview success.** First verify exact production schema and migration ledger with approved authority, complete disposable-Postgres qualification, review the diff and obtain explicit owner approval.

### PR #233 — deterministic PayFast ITN payment-date parsing

- URL: https://github.com/zaidhqdev-sys/GHM/pull/233
- Branch: `fix/payfast-payment-date-timezone-20261108`
- Head: `ea028a20967b686e90ea0fbe451a8e4b9dee57ef`
- Base: `main` at `0e2c7c2`
- Status at inspection: open, draft, not merged.
- CI run #2136 was reported successful; Cloudflare Pages preview succeeded at https://fix-payfast-payment-date-tim.ghm-cu1.pages.dev.
- Change treats timezone-less PayFast `payment_date` as UTC and preserves explicit offsets.
- PR description says local build/test was not yet run and asks for confirmation of provider timestamp convention before live payment processing.
- **Keep draft.** Do not treat preview or CI as provider-convention confirmation or authorization for payment processing/callback rollout.

## 6. Database inventory and production evidence

### Render database resources

| Resource | Database | Resource ID | State at inspection | Role in this work |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ghm-db` | `ghm_db` | `dpg-dag0sdtbedkc7389vi2g-a` | available | Production/internal DB |
| `ghm-payfast-sandbox-db` | `ghm_payfast_sandbox_db` | `dpg-db4416vlk1mc73eocug0-a` | suspended; billing suspender; expiry recorded 2026-11-08 01:17:15 UTC | Separate expired sandbox DB; not a deployment target/readiness signal |
| `ghm-identity-qualification-20261018` | `ghm_identity_qualification_20261018` | `dpg-dba0tu3rjlhs738fs2sg-a` | available | Separate qualification resource; not production |

### Production read-only observations from prior inspection

- `current_database() = ghm_db`.
- Query connection reported `current_user = ghm_db_user`.
- Migration ledger relation exists as `ghm.ghm_schema_migrations`; `public.ghm_schema_migrations` does not exist.
- `ghm_schema_owner` exists as NOLOGIN; `ghm_payment_provider` and `ghm_migrator` roles exist.
- SELECT on `ghm.ghm_schema_migrations` was denied to the inspection identity. Catalog evidence identifies `ghm_schema_owner` as owner; no broad grants were changed.
- The connector could not assume `ghm_schema_owner` in its read-only query session. Exact production migration ledger rows/checksums and applied migration count are therefore **unverified**.
- Runtime startup's initial `SELECT 1` only proves the startup connection succeeded at that time. It does not prove migration completion or application-level readiness.

### PayFast role / sandbox context

The November 5 operator handover records unresolved least-privilege/role-administration concerns, including the `ghm_db_user` privilege graph and an unsuccessful revocation attempt due to grantor mismatch. Treat that handover as a mandatory gate; do not infer readiness merely because `ghm_payment_provider` exists.

The separate PayFast sandbox DB is now suspended/expired according to current Render inventory. Do not query it, revive it, migrate it, point services at it, or use it as a deployment signal without a distinct owner-approved recovery decision. This does not change the status of the separate identity qualification DB.

No production migration, DDL, role/grant change, credential read, database write, payment write, or service environment change was performed during this reconstruction.

## 7. Explicitly unchanged during this reconstruction

- No merge or PR state change.
- No deploy, rollback, restart, or Render configuration change.
- No enabling of auto-deploy; it remains disabled.
- No migration, DDL, ledger write, database role/grant change, or payment write.
- No secrets or environment-variable values read.
- No local checkout change, cherry-pick, or bulk deployment.
- No change to the PayFast sandbox service or expired sandbox database.

## 8. Next actions and release gates

1. **Preserve this record and keep it current.** Update this handover after every material repo, PR, qualification, DB, Render, deployment, or verification action. Record UTC timestamp, exact ref/SHA/resource, action, outcome, evidence link/output, and what was deliberately not changed.
2. Use the owner-approved, read-only production migration audit path with an identity authorized to assume `ghm_schema_owner`. Do not broaden connector permissions or guess migration state. Capture exact ledger rows/checksums and reconcile all migrations against current `main`.
3. Separately reconcile production schema against PR #232's proposed contract using approved read-only inspection. Qualify its migration on disposable PostgreSQL and review the exact head before any owner decision.
4. Keep PR #233 draft until PayFast's documented timestamp convention is confirmed from authoritative provider documentation/evidence and local build/test plus exact-head CI are complete.
5. Diagnose the November 7 generic HTTP errors using correlated logs and a verified route/health probe. Improve logging in a separately reviewed code change.
6. Only after database/schema/role/backup/restore/network/observability gates are evidenced, prepare a forward-only release sequence. Each coherent release requires explicit authorization, one deployment to `GHM-Internal-Runtime`, and recorded verification before the next. Auto-deploy stays off.
7. Do not use the expired PayFast sandbox runtime/DB as a target or readiness signal. Keep PayFast production callback activation and settlement changes under their separate NO-GO/owner-approval gates.

## 9. Evidence sources consulted

- GitHub `main` commit metadata and compare from `d6d3519` to `main`.
- GitHub PR #232 and #233 metadata and commit lists.
- Render read-only service configuration, deploy history, service events, app logs and request logs for `srv-damupsek1f9s73eq8kkg`.
- Render read-only PostgreSQL resource inventory.
- Existing repository handovers: `docs/HANDOVER_2026-11-06_DEPENDENCY_SECURITY_REFRESH.md`, `docs/operations/payfast-production-role-provisioning-session-handover-2026-11-05.md`, and `docs/operations/handover-production-db-and-render-2026-10-24.md`.
- Existing current-state index, remaining-work register, and runtime reconciliation gate.

**Confidence discipline:** Facts explicitly labeled “observed” come from the source queries above or previously recorded operator evidence. PR descriptions are attributed to the PR, not treated as proof of production state. Any item labeled unverified remains a gate, not an assumption.
